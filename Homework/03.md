## Homework for Chapter 3

### Question 1

In inferno-os, applications use the Styx protocol to communicate with the file servers. These file servers are served by the namespaces (Which is shown in figure 3-2 as `Name space Management`).

The styx protocol is what makes inferno-os very strong in distributed computing.

### Question 2

Software interrupts are used to create subroutine calls. This is not neccessary due to the method inferno has implemented it's kernel using the Styx protocol.


### Question 4

Initially eve is used as the "owner" of all the resources and built-in services. The inital user for eve is set to the default "inferno" until we know who we are. This user is overriden when a user logs in. This is also overriden if inferno can get information from the host.


### Question 5

As mentioned in the Origins of Inferno, they thought that "the new computing world was no longer a central system with many users connected ..." So they assumed that the system will run with one user and they made that user the "superuser" or simply the user who controlled everything.

In my opinion this was/is a terrible move.

### Question 7

Honestly I had no idea about this, but I think [this](http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/fp_state_save.html) is a really good source.

The fp subsytem needs to be saved so the VM can restore it upon context switching with different programs. Without this, the kernel would be "non-stable".
