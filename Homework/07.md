## Homework for Chapter 7

### Question 2

Assuming it has been decoded, if we do this we're not incrementing the program counter. This makes it so any instruction after this referenced in the operation wouldn't reference this instruciton but rather the next one. Without it the program's instructions would not run properly and could break.

### Question 4

We only need to check for virtual machines that have a program ready to run. Idle virtual machines are of no use for us and contain no code. Checking them would serve no purpose.

### Question 5

Because tasks are added to the tail of the running virtual machine list. We don't need to see the tail of idle virtual machines since it serves no purpsoe for us. It doesn't matter which idle vm we pick to run code for us but choosing the "next" loaded vm ensures round-robin scheduling.
